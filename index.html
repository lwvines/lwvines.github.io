      <p>Hello! My name is Lisa Vines and I am an upcoming graduate of Appalachian State University and Wake Tech, majoring in Communication Studies and Web Development. Although I am continuously updating my education, I am not new to the Communication and Media career field. In October 2021, I completed a nine-year career in the North Carolina National Guard as a Public Affairs Specialist. For six of those years, I worked full-time in the Public Affairs Office as a Graphic Illustrator and Photojournalist. My work has given me the opportunity to travel to the Czech Republic to cover NATO events, Italy for cross-military aerial training, across North Carolina to support extreme weather and civil support missions, and so much more. I have also worked in JFK Special Warfare School’s Strategic Communications office as a photojournalist to document US military and international Special Forces training.</p>
      <p>Prior to my military experience, I worked for the Wake County Board of Elections as an Elections Assistant, processing registrations, answering voter calls and questions on Election Day, and various other responsibilities. I have also worked as an Office Manager and Executive Assistant at a variety of organizations as a temporary employee, earning the “top ambassador” rank from my employment agency.</p>
